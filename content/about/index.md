# About Retrobun Collection ðŸŽ®

Hi, Iâ€™m Jenny â€” welcome to **Retrobun Collection**!  

This blog is all about my love for retro games and the amazing community of collectors who keep these classics alive. Here, I share guides, stories, and tips on:

- ðŸ•¹ **Collecting** retro consoles, cartridges, and accessories  
- ðŸ”Ž **Spotting fakes** and bootlegs in the wild  
- ðŸ›  **Repairing & preserving** classic hardware and carts  
- ðŸ“š **Documenting history** so it doesnâ€™t fade away  

I started Retrobun Collection because I noticed how many newcomers to collecting were unsure about whatâ€™s real, whatâ€™s fake, and whatâ€™s worth saving. Hopefully, these guides help you grow your collection with confidence!  

Thanks for visiting â€” and if youâ€™ve got stories, tips, or discoveries of your own, Iâ€™d love to hear them.
