**Pokémon on the DS: Why HeartGold & SoulSilver Are Collector’s Gems**

Do you remember the first time you set foot in Johto? Maybe it was on a chunky Game Boy Color cartridge back in 2000, or maybe your journey began later on the Nintendo DS with the sparkling remake. Either way, for many of us, Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver are the definition of “comfort food gaming.” They’re not just remakes—they’re love letters to one of the most beloved regions in Pokémon history.

***A Quick Refresher on HeartGold & SoulSilver***

Released in 2009 in Japan and 2010 internationally, HeartGold and SoulSilver brought the Johto region roaring back to life on the DS. These weren’t just graphical updates of Gold and Silver—they were packed with new features that blended nostalgia with modern gameplay. Your lead Pokémon could walk behind you (yes, even Lugia waddles along), online trading and battling were a tap away, and you could explore not one but two regions: Johto and Kanto.

The star accessory was the Pokéwalker, a pedometer that let you carry a Pokémon in your pocket, earn experience, and find items simply by walking around. It felt like a preview of Pokémon GO—years early.

***Why These DS Remakes Are Collector Catnip***

Complete-In-Box (CIB) Premiums: Original case, manual, inserts, and Pokéwalker bump prices significantly. Sealed bundles are grail-tier for many collectors.

Pokéwalker Scarcity: Many got separated, lost, or broke. Working units with the original clip and packaging are increasingly tough to find.

Nostalgia Timing: Fans of the original GBC games came of age with disposable income right as these DS remakes matured—perfect storm.

Replay Value: Dual-region content, postgame battles, and quality-of-life updates make these titles highly “playable collectibles.”

**Beginner Tips: Buying Smart and Avoiding Fakes**

Authentication basics (DS era):

Inspect the cart label: print quality should be crisp, not fuzzy.

Look for the etched number on the front label and the board code visible through the back plastic when held to light.

The back of legitimate DS carts is embossed with the proper “Nintendo” and model text and has a clean, consistent font.

***Pokéwalker specifics:***

Expect to pay a premium for sets that include it.

It uses a coin cell battery—replace carefully to maintain functionality.

Check the screen for dead pixels and confirm button responsiveness if possible.

Buy for play vs. collect:

Play-focused? A loose cart is fine and far more affordable.

Display/collect? Aim for CIB with clean spine, intact manuals, and undamaged tray—plus the Pokéwalker and its inserts if you can swing it.

**Storage & preservation:**

Keep boxes out of direct sunlight to prevent fading.

Avoid extreme temps/humidity; DS cases can warp and manuals can ripple.

If you use the Pokéwalker, store it separately in a soft pouch to avoid screen scratches.

Fun Facts to Flex in the Comments

The Pokéwalker isn’t just a step counter—some items and encounters are exclusive to it via specific routes.

HeartGold/SoulSilver are the only mainline entries of their era where every Pokémon sprite can follow you around, a beloved feature that largely disappeared until much later spin-offs/entries revived the idea.

Dual-region gameplay (“Johto then Kanto”) gives HG/SS a scope most Pokémon titles don’t match—big replay value equals lasting collector interest.

**What to Collect First (Starter Checklist)**

Loose cart of either HG or SS to revisit Johto on a budget.

CIB copy with manual and inserts (watch for counterfeit manuals).

Pokéwalker in working order; original box set if you want the crown jewel.

Optional: Display extras like DS-era promo posters, club inserts, or the outer cardboard bundle sleeve for that museum look.

**Why Newcomers Love These Two**

They’re easy to enjoy even if you haven’t touched Pokémon in years: clean pixel art, quality-of-life tweaks, and a cozy loop of catching, training, and exploring across two regions. For many, HG/SS is the perfect “return ticket” to the series—modern enough to feel smooth, classic enough to feel like home.

Wrap-Up: Johto, But Make It Timeless

For many players, HeartGold and SoulSilver weren’t just games—they were a bridge between childhood memories and modern Pokémon. Whether you’re dusting off your DS to replay them or hunting down a mint CIB copy with that elusive Pokéwalker, these titles are a must-have for anyone building a retro Pokémon collection.
