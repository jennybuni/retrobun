If you’re reading this, chances are you’ve felt it—that little tug of nostalgia when you see a Pokémon Red cartridge on Instagram, or a neatly lined shelf of NES boxes at a flea market. Maybe you’ve been itching to replay the games you grew up with, or you just love the idea of owning a piece of gaming history. Either way, welcome to the world of retro game collecting. It’s a hobby that blends childhood memories, treasure hunting, and just the right dash of chaos. Let’s talk about how to get started without overwhelming yourself.

## Step One: Pick Your Anchor Game

Every collection needs a starting point—something that grounds you and keeps you motivated. For a lot of folks, Pokémon is the perfect anchor. Think back: did you play Pokémon Red or Blue at recess? Were you the kid with Pokémon Yellow and the special Pikachu edition Game Boy Color? Maybe you skipped straight to FireRed and LeafGreen on the Game Boy Advance.

Whatever your personal “first Pokémon” was, start there. Hunt down a copy of the game you remember most fondly. The thrill of holding that chunky little gray cartridge or popping a translucent GBA cart into a handheld again is what kicks the collecting bug into high gear.

## Step Two: Learn the Lingo

Retro collecting can sound like a secret club until you know the terms. Here are a few basics that pop up often:

Loose – Just the cartridge. Usually the cheapest way to buy. Great if you want to play.

CIB (Complete in Box) – Cartridge, original box, and instruction manual. Collectors drool over this.

Sealed – Factory-wrapped, never opened. These can cost eye-watering amounts, but they’re like fossils preserved in amber.

Repro (Reproduction) – Fan-made copies of games or boxes. They can look great, but don’t pay collector prices for them by mistake.

Pro tip: Don’t feel pressured to chase CIB or sealed games right away. Loose carts are affordable, easy to find, and perfect for reliving the experience.

## Step Three: Decide What Kind of Collector You Want to Be

Some collectors focus on just one series (Pokémon-only shelves are very real). Others try to collect entire console libraries. And then there are hybrid collectors who just pick up whatever sparks joy.

If you’re starting small, I recommend focusing on one series or one console. Pokémon alone is a deep rabbit hole: the Game Boy era, the GBA remakes, spin-offs like Pokémon Pinball (with the built-in rumble!), and even oddities like Hey You, Pikachu! for the N64. Narrowing your focus will save you money and keep things fun.

Step Four: Where to Find Games

Now the fun part: the hunt. Here are some beginner-friendly hunting grounds:

Local game shops – Many cities have retro shops where you can browse in person. Prices vary, but you’ll usually avoid fakes.

Conventions & flea markets – Treasure-hunting vibes at their peak. Bring cash and haggle politely.

Online marketplaces (eBay, Mercari, etc.) – Huge selection, but be careful of repros. Always check seller ratings and cartridge photos.

Friends & family – Don’t overlook this one. You’d be amazed how many people still have a shoebox of games in the attic.

## Step Five: Learn How to Spot the Real Deal

One of the biggest beginner mistakes is accidentally buying a fake. Pokémon games, in particular, are heavily counterfeited. A few quick tells:

Label quality – Originals have crisp printing and a glossy finish. Repros often look blurry or too shiny.

Cartridge color – GBA Pokémon carts were transparent with glittery plastic (like Emerald’s green). If it looks off, it probably is.

Back screws – Authentic carts use a special “tri-wing” screw, not a regular Phillips head.

There are more advanced ways (like checking the circuit board), but these basics will save you from most scams.

## Step Six: Don’t Forget to Play

This might sound obvious, but collecting isn’t just about lining up trophies on a shelf. Pop those cartridges into a Game Boy and let the pixelated nostalgia wash over you. Hearing the classic Pokémon battle music from real hardware hits differently than any emulator can deliver.

And here’s a fun bonus: loose Pokémon games often have old save files. Boot one up and you might discover someone else’s journey—like a level 72 Blastoise named “BUBBA” or a half-finished Pokédex from 2001. It’s like archaeology for gamers.

## Final Thoughts: Start Slow, Have Fun

The best part of collecting is that it’s yours. There’s no right or wrong way to do it. If all you ever want is a loose copy of Pokémon Yellow because that’s what you had as a kid, that’s perfect. If you dream of someday owning a glass case with sealed copies of every generation, go for it.

Start with one game. Learn the ropes. Share your finds online (collectors love cheering each other on). And above all, let the hobby bring you joy.

Because when you hold that little gray Pokémon cartridge, you’re not just collecting plastic—you’re holding a piece of your childhood. And that’s worth more than any price guide can tell you.
