      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;nostalgia-time&#34;&gt;Nostalgia time:&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Remember the first time you heard that clock tick—tick—tick and your stomach did a little flip? For some of us it was a chunky SNES cart; for others (hi, that’s us today) it was the slick snap of a Nintendo DS cartridge sliding into place. Either way, Chrono Trigger isn’t just a game—it’s a time machine that still smells faintly of fresh manual ink and late-night hot chocolate.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Maybe you clipped it to your backpack in school, proudly shaking it during class to rack up steps (and hoping your teacher wouldn’t notice). For many of us, &lt;em&gt;Pokémon HeartGold&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;SoulSilver&lt;/em&gt; weren’t just DS cartridges—they were our golden tickets back to Johto, complete with a Tamagotchi-style gadget that made us feel like real Trainers again.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you’re reading this, chances are you’ve felt it—that little tug of nostalgia when you see a Pokémon Red cartridge on Instagram, or a neatly lined shelf of NES boxes at a games shop. Maybe you’ve been itching to replay the games you grew up with, or you just love the idea of owning a piece of gaming history. Either way, welcome to the world of retro game collecting. It’s a hobby that blends childhood memories, treasure hunting, and just the right dash of chaos. Let’s talk about how to get started without overwhelming yourself.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
